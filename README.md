# JC Jump!

JC Jump! is an original game designed and developed in the programming language C. To play the game, the player must type in the words displayed on the computer screen correctly to score the highest possible score and simultaneously make the character in the game jump to avoid hitting the bottom of the screen.

The game is run on the DE1-SoC computer with an ARMv7 processor. 

There are multiple features in this game, one of them being difficulty level. By configuring the switches on the computer system, it starts the game with the corresponding difficulty level. Switch 0, 1, and 2 represent easy, medium, and hard difficulty respectively.

Easy mode consists of the game providing 3-4 letter words to the user to type in to score a point.
Medium mode consists of 4-6 letter words, and hard mode consists of 7+ letter words.

A player loses the game when they are unable to type in the word correctly with the time given and the character hits the bottom of the screen. Additionally, the user will have 3 lives, and typing an incorrect word makes them lose a life. After all lives are lost, the user loses the game as well. When a life is lost, the player gets a free pass, so the character in the game will jump.

There are also push buttons on the computer system. Push button 0 causes the game to speed up and be on fast mode, and push button 1 causes the game to slow down.

The below videos are some examples on how the game is played, and is shown using a computer system simulator called CPUlator, which replaces the need for an actual DE1-SoC computer.
